zfs-periodic-snapshots
======================

Tools for generating accessible ZFS snapshots for serving immutable data

Originally designed to create and serve snapshots of software repsoitories, but should be adaptable to other uses.

This project makes use of the icons from the public-domain [Apaxy theme](https://github.com/oupala/apaxy).
